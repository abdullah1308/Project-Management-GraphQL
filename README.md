# Project-Management-GraphQL
A simple project management application built to learn GraphQL. The front-end is built using React and the back-end using Node and Express. MongoDB Atlas is used as the database with Mongoose as the data modelling library.

## Setup Instructions

 1. Rename **.env-public** to **.env** and fill it out. Set `NODE_ENV` to *'development'* in order to make requests using *GraphiQL*
 
 2. Run `npm start` to start the back-end
 
 3. Run `npm start` in the **client** folder to start the front-end. The application should be visible on http://localhost:3000
